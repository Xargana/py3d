# Cube Viewer with OpenGL and Pygame

This is a simple OpenGL application that displays a textured cube. It supports frame limiting, texture switching, and anti-aliasing settings. The cube can be rotated using the mouse, and various settings can be adjusted in real time using keyboard hotkeys.

## Hotkeys
### Frame Limiting:
- `F` + `1`: Enable frame limiting at 1 FPS
- `F` + `2`: Enable frame limiting at 2 FPS
- `F` + `3`: Enable frame limiting at 3 FPS
- `F` + `4`: Enable frame limiting at 4 FPS
- `F` + `5`: Enable frame limiting at 5 FPS
- `F` + `0`: Disable frame limiting

### Texture Switching:
- `T` + `1`: Load texture 1
- `T` + `2`: Load texture 2
- `T` + `3`: Load texture 3

### Anti-Aliasing:
- `A` + `1`: Set anti-aliasing to 2x
- `A` + `2`: Set anti-aliasing to 4x
- `A` + `3`: Set anti-aliasing to 8x
- `A` + `4`: Set anti-aliasing to 16x
- `A` + `0`: Disable anti-aliasing

## Requirements
This project uses the following dependencies:
- `pygame` - For creating the window and handling input.
- `PyOpenGL` - For rendering the 3D cube.
- `Pillow` - For loading textures.

### Installing Dependencies
To install the required dependencies, you can run:

```bash
pip install pygame PyOpenGL Pillow
